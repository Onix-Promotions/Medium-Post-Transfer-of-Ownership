Under new ownership: “Not” so hostile takeover
As our team has progressed through the BSC and ETH scene bringing value to a multitude of tokens, some successful and some not as is the nature of the game we feel we can go no further in terms of both the “Work Winning” & “Work Doing” aspect of the industry hence the decision to step aside and pursue new separate ventures.

Moving forward we are handing all property over Darran Browne

Darran has an extensive knowledge of the industry from smart contracts, bot development and token growth. As a founder of TCS (Token Consulting Services) and a Co-Founder of both ModAllstars and Etherexium there is no better person to fulfill the needs of this site.

We wish Darran all the best with growing Onix and cleaning up the smart contract space via KYC and audits prior to any contract taking place

Any previous contact address such as Team-US and Team-EU will no longer be reachable.

Yours Faithfully,

Tony, Dave (Team-US) & Michael(Team-EU)
